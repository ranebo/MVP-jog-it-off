There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  >'Jog it Off'

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  >For those wondering if they should eat that donut or eat that additional slice of pizza, 'Jog it Off' will give you some additional insight to see if you want to take that leap.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  >'Jog it Off' allows you to enter the calories of a treat you want to eat or search to find the amount of calories for a particular meal. Then you simply enter how fast you run and your weight and we will tell you how long you need to jog inorder to burn of that meal. Additionally, you can signup and keep track of your meals and which meals you have jogged off, as well as keep track of your eating trends and habits.
## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  >Often we feel guilty when we indulge our tastebuds a little more then maybe we think we should. If you're going to eat something you should always be able to enjoy it guilt free, or alternativly, maybe you just need a little push of encouragment to skip it knowing you don't need it...
## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  >'Jog it Off' allows additional support when commiting to that tough decision of 'should I?'' or 'shouldn't I?'. By showing how long an individual would need to run to burn off the colaries of that meal that they want, we frame and inform the decision in a way that can help lead to a better choice. Either you are fine with the amount of time you would need to jog it off, and you can enjoy your meal guilt free, knowing you now have a presribed course of action to remedy your indulgence, or you decide it's not worth it to jog that long and can easily skip that treat.

  >Customer - "I LOVE 'Jog it Off', it really puts what I am eating into perspective. Now if I want it, I don't feel bad becuase I know what I need to do to have it... I just have to 'Jog it Off' (lol). And when I'm feeling a little lazy and see how long I'd have to run for that one cookie, its easy to say 'NO WAY!
